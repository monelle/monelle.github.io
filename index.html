            Have a look around and see what I have been up to lately.</p>
            <p>Currently learning programming with She Codes Perth. Once a
                graphic designer with an interest in typography and UI/UX. Training
                to transition into a full-stack developer role.<p>

                    <p>The client was developing a website to display complex data analysis tools.
                        I delivered a layout that was both legible for the end user and practical for the back-end peeps to populate
